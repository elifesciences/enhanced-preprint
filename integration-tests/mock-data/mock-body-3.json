Among the 30 genes with TIPs in indica and japonica that have the highest population branch statistics (PBS) – an indicator of strong differential selection - 13 have more than one TIP-eQTL. This suggests that TIPs are a major source of gene expression variability in rice, in particular in genes that may have been strongly selected during the recent evolution of rice.
